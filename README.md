# learning-rust
simple project to learn rust from generic code samples

## List of branches
- `master` : is just a simple starting point probably... :?
- `simple-cli-tool` : is a really basic cli tool branch just to see how it works
- `proper-cli-tool` : is a proper cli tool made using clap lib

## Purpose of the Project
Not much just for me to practice some stuff and use it as a code repo for any or all talks that I give. ;)

## Requirements
**This project uses the 2018 Rust edition from the stable channel**

## Common breaking problems from old versions
- `extern` is missing here
- dunno you tell me

## FAQ
### Is all the code usable and free?
 Yes, it's all usable and free(under MIT) but I did say use it just for learning you can write better code than this. :D
### Will there be more code added to this project?
 Very likely. Yes. I will more and more code to this place just to share some of the new stuff I learn I guess.
### Will the code here ever get any more complicated?
 Probably but not very likely most of my proper projects will have a separate repo and this place is just for simple projects. If you want to follow me to see what other projects I might work on.. :P
