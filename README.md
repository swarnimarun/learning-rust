# learning-rust: the guide


This is the repo that contains my learning rust series of presentations and code as of 2023, March.

I will try to keep it cleaned up from now on, feel free to create issues in case I miss something.

All the code here is MIT licensed so feel free to copy and learn. Credits would be nice if you use it for your own works though.  :)
